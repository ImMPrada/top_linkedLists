## Linked Lists

A challenge on [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-linked-lists)

"In Computer Science one of the most basic and fundamental data structures is the linked list, which functions similarly to an array. The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can easily be inserted or removed without reallocation of any other elements.

In some programming languages the size of an array is a concern and one of the ways to overcome that problem and allow dynamically allocated data is using linked lists.

Luckily in Ruby arrays aren’t limited to a certain size, so you don’t have to think about overcoming that limitation.

So if array size is not a limitation in Ruby, are linked lists really necessary? The short answer to that is no; however, it’s the simplest of the dynamic data structures and it will give you a solid foundation, so you can understand more complex data structures like graphs and binary trees with more ease."

### How to try

- clone the repo
- got to de repo's folder on your machine
- this repo solution is using Ruby 3.1.2, if you are using rbenv: `rbenv local 3.1.2`
- run `bundle install`, this allows you to run specs
- solution propoused is at lib/
- to run specs: `bundle exec rspec rspec`
